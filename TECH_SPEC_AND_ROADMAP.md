**Technical Specifications:**

1. **Platform Compatibility:**
   - Initial development for watchOS.
   - Future multi-platform expansion to Android Wear OS, PineTime, etc.

2. **User Preferences:**
   - Ability to customize the interruption levels of Do Not Disturb (DND) modes.
   - Settings to define user availability, such as disabling interruptions during sleep, mindfulness, and theater mode.
   
3. **Sedentary Timer:**
   - Activation based on heart rate data and physical orientation (sitting vs. standing).
   - Timer starts after detecting a heart rate below a predefined threshold for 'walking heart rate' or when the watch detects a 'sitting' state.

4. **Movement Prompts:**
   - At 25 minutes of sedentary behavior, initiate a haptic prompt for movement.
   - Increasingly insistent prompts over time, with an adjustable scale for intensity.
   - Options for sound notifications after a certain period, with contextual and user preference controls.

5. **Movement Timer:**
   - Triggered when movement detected exceeds a set threshold.
   - Sedentary and movement timers reset after 5 minutes of sustained movement.

**User Experience:**

1. **Onboarding:**
   - Step-by-step guide on setting up the app with default settings.
   - Education component explaining the concept of "movement snacks" and their benefits.

2. **Notification System:**
   - Graduated notification system starting with subtle prompts, progressing to more noticeable alerts.
   - Customizable 'snooze' feature for movement reminders.

3. **Activity Logging:**
   - Log each "movement snack" and sedentary period.
   - Visual statistics on daily, weekly, and monthly activity.

**Development Roadmap:**

1. **Phase 1 - MVP Features:**
   - Basic movement detection and reminder system.
   - Adjustable user preferences for notifications.
   
2. **Phase 2 - Enhanced Features:**
   - Integration with health data for more accurate activity measurement.
   - Additional personalization options for user notifications.
   
3. **Phase 3 - Cross-Platform Support:**
   - Prepare for multi-platform development.
   - Establish guidelines for Android and other platforms.
   
4. **Phase 4 - Monetization and Partnership:**
   - Explore partnerships with health-focused non-profits.
   - Develop a revenue-sharing model for contributors.
   - If monetized, establish a non-profit for ongoing maintenance and support.

**Collaboration and Contribution:**

- Use GitHub for version control and collaboration.
- Open-source license to encourage community contributions.
- Regular meetings to discuss progress, features, and community feedback.

**Revenue Sharing Model:**

- Define a clear revenue sharing model if the app is monetized.
- Consider creating or partnering with a non-profit organization for the distribution of funds.

**Legal and Compliance:**

- Ensure compliance with all applicable health data privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
- Develop a privacy policy that outlines how user data will be used and protected.

This structured approach provides a clear guide for developers and ensures that the project stays aligned with its health-focused goals. The specifications are designed to be scalable and adaptable for future platforms and features.
