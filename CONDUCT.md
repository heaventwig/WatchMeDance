## Project WatchMeDance Code of Conduct: Interaction Guidelines for Contributors

### Welcome
This document outlines our interaction standards for everyone participating in WatchMeDance. Our community is dedicated to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and supportive environment for contributors of all backgrounds and skill levels.

### Core Values
- **Empathy:** Approach all interactions with kindness and consideration for others' experiences and viewpoints.
- **Curiosity:** Encourage questions and a thirst for understanding. We are a community of learners and teachers.
- **Respect:** Treat every individual with dignity and respect. Embrace diversity and reject discrimination. Contempt has no home here.
- **Intent:** Start from an assumption of positive intent; ask about how a person's positive intent informed their behavior.
- **Impact:** Acknowledge and address the impact of actions, including with sensory-specific feedback like "when X occurred, I noticed Z."

### Communication Standards
- **Positive Discourse:** Maintain a constructive and positive tone in all forms of communication.
- **Clarity:** Aim for clarity and be mindful of the varied levels of language proficiency among contributors.
- **Inclusivity:** Use inclusive language and be sensitive to differences in culture, gender, and experience.

### Diversity and Inclusion
- **Welcoming Atmosphere:** Actively create an atmosphere that welcomes diverse perspectives and fosters inclusion.
- **Mentorship:** Offer help to newcomers and mentorship opportunities to help them grow within the community.
- **Accessibility:** Strive to make our project accessible to people with disabilities.

### Conflict Resolution
- **Constructive Feedback:** Offer feedback in a way that is helpful and aimed at improvement, not criticism.
- **Graceful Acceptance:** Be open to receiving feedback and willing to learn from it.
- **Mediation:** In the event of a disagreement, seek mediation from project maintainers or community leaders.
- **Short-Circuit Protection:** Project maintainers and community leaders must decline to process some things. If they do not, they are risking burnout and jeopardizing the future of the project.

### Recognition and Growth
- **Acknowledge Contributions:** Recognize the efforts of all contributors, whether their contribution is big or small.
- **Leadership Opportunities:** Provide opportunities for contributors to lead initiatives or take on new responsibilities.

### Safety and Reporting
- **Code of Conduct:** Adhere to the project’s Code of Conduct at all times. This is not optional.
- **Reporting Mechanism:** Provide a clear mechanism for reporting inappropriate behavior or harassment, ensuring confidentiality and support.

### Sustainability and Self-Care
- **Work-Life Balance:** Encourage contributors to maintain a healthy work-life balance.
- **Burnout Prevention:** Promote sustainable practices to prevent contributor burnout.

### Evolution of Guidelines
- **Iterative Improvement:** These guidelines are not static; they will evolve with the community’s needs and contributions.
- **Community Input:** Regularly solicit input from the community on how these guidelines can be improved.

### Governance Processes
- **Ad-Hocracy:** Until such time as the project has sufficient momentum and interest to support more complex governance structures (in addition to project development, at least mutual co-development and social interaction), we do what we do because we choose to do it and we can do it. We know we can do it because we do it.
- **Benevolent Dictatorship:** Until there is sufficient activity to transition out of ad-hocracy, this project is a (potentially distributed) dictatorship run by the maintainer (of each respective fork).
- **Sociocracy:** The project's original creator envisions a sociocratic circle organization structure to take over policy-making and project governance from this blend of benevolent dictatorship & adhocracy.

### Final Note
Our collective intelligence and collaborative effort are what make WatchMeDance exceptional. By adhering to these interaction guidelines, we create a vibrant and productive environment where all contributors can feel valued and engaged. We believe that by welcoming and onboarding newcomers effectively, we can bridge the diversity gap and drive the project to new heights. Let us be a community that leads by example.
